- 👋 Hi, I’m Shabir Ahmad. I am currently working as a Research Professor at Gachon University, South Korea in the Department of IT Convergence Engineering. I more than 7 years of professional experience in developing solution for different clients using PHP and its popular frameworks.
- 👀 I’m interested in investigating the use of Visual AI in medical imaging and using IoT to acquire medical data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reinforcement learning and exploring the possibilities on how to acheive various challenges in healthcare by leveraging reinforcement learning rather than conventional supervised or unsupervised learning approaches which requires a massive volume of data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the topic of Healthcare 5.0, digital health in metaverse using contemporary machine learning techniques and reinforcement learning.
- 📫 Reach me out at shabir@gachon.ac.kr, ngnr.shabir@gmail.com.
